	   <h1>Sooo This is basically how I want the thing to look like. Simple, natural. So it goes laser etched or whatever into it. But laser power will be super strong and it will look singed like it was written with Satan's typewriter or something!!! </h1>
	   <h3>I'd change the "book" part to one line at a time though</h3>
	   <p>so in an ideal world I wanted this thing to be on an eternal loop, not a scroll, but now I'm realizing that thats not quite so possible as a loop with one sentence in the box hole at a time would make the box reaaalllllyy obnoxiously long. Goodbye dreams. It was fun while it lasted. </p>
