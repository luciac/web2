	   <h1>"I want there to be a sort of scroll inside this box that will serve as a sort of book. And to read on the reader would have to crank the book somehow. I have some ideas here below."</h1>
	   <h3>is what it says in the box animation to your left</h3>
	   <p>so in an ideal world, I would love to have a simple solution to make the page inside an eternal loop rather than a scroll. My professor and I have come up with some ideas that may work </p>

	   <h2>Idea one... </h2>
	   <img src="images/sketch302.jpg" alt="idea one" class="one">
	   <p>This is the least functional of the ideas. An eternal loop with a tab sticking out the side to help you pull the page along.</p>

	   <h2>Idea two...</h2>
	   <img src="images/sketch303.jpg" alt="idea two" class="two">
	   <p>This idea was inspired by gears. There would be ridges on the underside of the paper and divits in these two poles and they would help push and pull the page along. I fear that there will be many problems because the paper will be too weak a material to push and pull.</p>

	   <h2>Idea three...</h2>
	   <img src="images/sketch304.jpg" alt="idea three" class="three">
	   <p>This was inspired by cameras that do the exact same thing I would like to do. The only problem with this idea is that I would like to not make the person reading have to "rewind" when they're done. the eternal loop wouldn't be possible in this format.</p>
