		<p>When angels cry their tears fall from the heavens and land in the bermuda triangle. The angel tears are so powerful they send you flying to another time in the bermuda triangle. In a parallel universe. However one cannot get back because angels don't cry in the parallel universe, they party and play limbo. And they win. Which results in even more parties, which result in earthquakes. Sucks to be you if you get pulled into the bermuda triangle.</p>

However they are chinchillas and they cannot make sense of the information they have been gifted with, for they don't understand mandarin chinese (the language in which the information is given) or speak it to pass the information on to fellow chinese speaking creatures (homo sapiens). Nor do they understand the information in any way at all. Most of the time they do not even think about it.</p>
