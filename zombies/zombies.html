		<p>The best way to protect your arms is with a good solid jacket. A strong enough jacket will stop most zombie bites. They won’t stop a machete if you do something stupid accidentally, but they will protect from bites and scratches. The best materials for jackets are real leather, and canvas. Because your arms extend so far from the rest of the body they are quite vulnerable. </p>
		<h2>Best Materials</h2>
		<ul class="options">
			<li class="leather"><h3 class="open">Leather</h3><p class="open">Leather is the best option for colder weather. Its stronger than nearly all man made textiles and is extremely tear and puncture resistant. They also give you extra bad-ass points.</p></li>
			<li class="canvas"><h3 class="closed">Canvas</h3><p class="closed">Canvas, although man made, is very durable and usually used for heavy outdoor work. Just try biting your way through a canvas jacket and you'll understand.</p></li>
			<li class="duck"><h3 class="closed">Duck</h3><p class="closed">Duck fabric is like canvas, only stronger. Which basically just makes it even better.</p></li>

		<h1><span class="dropdown">B</span>oots</h1>
		<p>Feet are your main vehicle. They need to be protected. Boots not only protect you from zombies, they also protect you from the elements. Waterproof boots keep your feet dry which is much more important than you could possibly realize. Wet boots are heavier, which in turn will tire you out more. Wet feet for a long period of time can lead to sickness. The last thing you want is a terrible cold when you’re trying to run for your life. Good boots will help you through snow as well.<br><br>
The right boot to buy is a good strong athletic pair that covers your ankles. Hiking boots work best. But make sure to break them in and wear good socks. Blisters could mean the end of you. Athletic boots were designed and built for long usage in rough terrain, which is why they are your best option.</p>

		<h1><span class="dropdown">C</span>rossbows</h1>
		<p>Your clothing offer defensive protection, but you still need offensive protection: weapons. Guns are a big no when it comes to a zombie apocalypse, mainly because of sound. Having one long range weapon is extremely beneficial. Crossbows are the zombie apocalypse survivor’s best friend in any terrain. No permit or license is needed to purchase or own one. A license for hunting with one is needed though. It is important to know that the ability to own one does not give you the ability to use one. Read manuals, watch videos, or take a class. Your life depends on your skill with the weapon. 
		<!--
		The biggest pros to using a crossbow is that you don’t need to be face to face with a zombie. This makes large numbers easier to deal with. Ammunition for crossbows, arrows, are designed to be reused so you don’t need to worry about running out. Once you’ve killed a zombie for good, you can rip the arrow back out and use it again. This is also more cost effective.  
		The cons are that you are probably moving and so is your target. Your target is also probably a decent distance away. All of this makes hitting a zombie in the brain more difficult if you have little to no experience. Practice is paramount for using this weapon when it counts the most.--> </p>

		<h1><span class="dropdown">M</span>achete</h1>
		<p>Now that you have a long range weapon you’ll need a close range one. If a zombie is all up in your face the crossbow won’t be as easy to use. So now is the time for melee weapons. Machetes are one of the best options for close range combat. <br><br>
		The machete is a long and very sharp blade. Its orginal use is for cutting undergrowth in the rain forests, which can consist of strong, thick vines. Some people even use the machete to cut open coconuts. This is a great sign because coconuts are generally tougher than the human skull. If something can damage a coconut, it can damage a human skull easily. If you want to practice using your machete, using a coconut may be the way to go.</p>

		<p>No matter where you are, you will need to sleep. More importantly, you need to sleep where zombies can’t get you. If you can find a safe and fortified place, go for it. If you can’t, then the tensile tent is your perfect solution. Tensile tents are tents that hang from trees. There are plenty of trees in most cities: along streets, in parks, on campus grounds. Making sure they look thick enough is important. <br><br>
		There are two main types. Ones that hang for one point at the top, and ones that latch on from two or more points on the sides. The brand Tensile hangs from the sides meaning you’ll need two trees decently spaced apart. Although that’s an obvious downside, they are typically easier to set up than the ones that hang from one point. Time, in life and death situtaions, is paramount. The tensile tent also comes with the option of two person tents and three person tents.</p>

		<p>Getting injured is a serous deal in any apocalypse. Infected wounds can mean death. You need to be capable and equipped to deal with wounds. First aid kits are a definite yes. <br><br>
		There are two different ways you can go about getting your first aid kit. You can buy a pre-made first aid kit at any pharmacy. If you don’t buy a pre-made kit you can create your own from scratch. If you chose to create your own, put all of your medical equipment in a small organizable pack. This will make your medical equipment easier to access on the run.</p>

		<p>Staying healthy, nutrition wise, is an important thing most people don’t immediately think of. You’ll need to stay hydrated during the apocalypse while also traveling light. Carrying too much water can seriously weigh you down. And once you run out you need to worry about getting clean water.<br><br>
		The LifeStraw is a great companion that solves all of these problems. It filters out dirt, 99.9% of bacteria, and 99.9% of waterborne Protozoa making any water you drink it with completely safe.</p>
